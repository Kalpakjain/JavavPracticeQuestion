<b/>The basic problems of java which can help beginners for logic building.</b><br>
There is a Phase wise question set as below :<br>

Level 1 : <br>
1. Take a number and print whether it’s positive, negative, or zero.
2. Check if a number is divisible by 5.
3. Check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
4. Check if a given year is a leap year
5. Take a character and check if it’s a vowel or consonant.
6. Take a character and check whether it’s uppercase, lowercase, a digit, or a special character.

Phase 2 : 

7. Take three sides and check if they form a valid triangle. 
8. If the sides form a valid triangle, determine whether it is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
9. Take marks (0–100) and print the corresponding grade (A/B/C/D/F).
10. Check if one of two given numbers is a multiple of the other.
11. Take the hour of the day (0–23) and print “Good Morning”, “Good Afternoon” “Good Evening”, or “Good Night”.
12. Check voting eligibility for a given age (18+).
13. Take two numbers and determine whether both are even, both are odd, or one is even and one is odd.
14. Take an alphabet character and check if it lies between ‘a’ and ‘m’ or ‘n’ and ‘z’.
15. Take a day number (1–7) and print the corresponding day name.
16. Take a month number (1–12) and print the number of days in that month (ignore leap years).

Level 3: Math and Number Logic


17. Take a 3-digit number and check if all digits are distinct.
18. Take a 3-digit number and determine if the middle digit is the largest, smallest, or neither.
19. Take a 4-digit number and check if the first and last digits are equal.
20. Check whether a given integer is single-digit, double-digit, or multi-digit.
21. Check if a number is a multiple of 7 or ends with 7.
22. Take coordinates (x, y) and determine which quadrant the point lies in.
23. Check if an amount can be evenly divided into 2000, 500, and 100 currency notes.
24. Check if a number lies within the range [100, 999].
25. Take two angles of a triangle and compute the third angle.
26. Check whether a number is a perfect square (without using the square root function).

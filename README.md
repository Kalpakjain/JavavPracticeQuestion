10. Check if one of two given numbers is a multiple of the other.
11. Take the hour of the day (0–23) and print “Good Morning”, “Good Afternoon” “Good Evening”, or “Good Night”.
12. Check voting eligibility for a given age (18+).
13. Take two numbers and determine whether both are even, both are odd, or one is even and one is odd.
14. Take an alphabet character and check if it lies between ‘a’ and ‘m’ or ‘n’ and ‘z’.
15. Take a day number (1–7) and print the corresponding day name.
16. Take a month number (1–12) and print the number of days in that month (ignore leap years).


**Level 3: Math and Number Logic :**


17. Take a 3-digit number and check if all digits are distinct.
18. Take a 3-digit number and determine if the middle digit is the largest, smallest, or neither.
19. Take a 4-digit number and check if the first and last digits are equal.
20. Check whether a given integer is single-digit, double-digit, or multi-digit.
21. Check if a number is a multiple of 7 or ends with 7.
22. Take coordinates (x, y) and determine which quadrant the point lies in.
23. Check if an amount can be evenly divided into 2000, 500, and 100 currency notes.
24. Check if a number lies within the range [100, 999].
25. Take two angles of a triangle and compute the third angle.
26. Check whether a number is a perfect square (without using the square root function).


**Level 4: Logical Operators & Compound Statements :**

27. Take a character and check if it is a letter, a digit, or neither.
28. Take a number and print “Fizz” if divisible by 3,"Buzz" id divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if divisible by both.
29. Take three numbers and print the median value (neither maximum nor minimum).
30. Take 24-hour time (hours and minutes) and print whether it is AM or PM.
31. Take income and age, and check if eligible for tax (age > 18 and income > 5 L).
32. Take two numbers and check if both are positive and their sum is less than 100.
33. Take a single digit (0–9) and print its word form (“Zero” to “Nine”).
34. Take a weekday number (1–7) and determine if it is a weekday or weekend.
35. Take electricity units consumed and calculate the bill as per slabs (using if-else).
36. Take a password string and check basic rules (length ≥ 8 and contains at least one digit).


**Level 5: Creative / Tricky Logical Scenarios :**


37. Take coordinates (x, y) and check if the point lies on the X-axis, Y-axis, or at the origin.
38. Take three numbers and check if they can form a Pythagorean triplet.
39. Take day and month and check if it forms a valid calendar date (ignoring leap years).
40. Take time (hours and minutes) and print the smaller angle between the hour and minute hands.
41. Take three numbers and check if they are in arithmetic progression.
42. Take three numbers and check if they are in geometric progression.
43. Take a 3-digit number and check if the sum of the first and last digit equals the middle digit.
44. Take an integer (1–9999) and check if the sum of its digits is greater than the product of its digits.
45. Take two dates (day and month) and determine which one comes first in the calendar.
46. Take a year and print the corresponding century (e.g., “19th century”, “20th century”)
